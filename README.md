# Japan Influenza Surveillance Explorer

Interactive explorer for weekly sentinel surveillance reports by prefecture from Japan's Infectious Disease Weekly Report (IDWR). Pick up to six prefectures and an IDWR week to see:

- **Spatial Statistics:** global Moran's I, LISA clusters, a Moran scatterplot, and Moran's I by week
- **Chart:** weekly reports per sentinel site against the epidemic threshold (1.0) and the caution (10) and warning (30) levels, with EARS C2 alerts
- **Prefecture Map:** Kanto and Kansai, or your selected prefectures, with the rest of Japan faded
- **Japan Map:** all 47 prefectures with a ranked table
- **Alerts:** C2 by prefecture, alert outcomes, and the New Year check
- **Summary Table:** each prefecture's peak, first week at 1.0, first C2 alert, lead time and false alarms

The app file is `app.py`. Its version is in the file header and on screen, never in the file name.

## Layout

```
app.py                            the Streamlit app
requirements.txt
.streamlit/config.toml            theme, minimal toolbar, static serving
data/idwr_weekly.csv              weekly table written by the IDWR alert report R script (required)
data/prefecture_population.csv    2020 census population by prefecture (e-Stat), reference only
data/prefecture_names.csv         pref_code with English and Japanese names
static/japan_prefectures_display.geojson  map outlines (dataofjapan/land; small outlying islands dropped, simplified)
static/prefecture_labels.csv      label position for each prefecture
static/world_110m.json            Plotly world outline file, served locally so maps draw without the CDN
static/prefecture_neighbors.json  spatial weights built from the full-resolution boundaries
tools/build_neighbors.py          rebuilds the neighbors file (run locally; needs geopandas)
tests/test_app.py                 Streamlit AppTest script
sample/idwr_weekly_sample.csv     synthetic table for layout work only; do not upload
```

## Data contract for `data/idwr_weekly.csv`

One row per prefecture per ISO week per disease. No national row.

| column | type | note |
|---|---|---|
| year | int | ISO year |
| week | int | ISO week |
| week_start | date | Monday, YYYY-MM-DD |
| pref_code | int | 1 Hokkaido to 47 Okinawa (JIS X 0401) |
| prefecture | text | English name, as in `data/prefecture_names.csv` |
| disease | text | "Influenza", ... |
| per_sentinel | float | reports per sentinel site |
| sentinels | int | recommended; reporting sentinel sites that week |
| c2 | float | optional; EARS C2 from the R script |

Rows with a code outside 1 to 47 are dropped and reported on screen. If `c2` is missing, or New Year weeks are left out of the baselines (the default), the app computes C2 with the R report's rules: baseline weeks t-9 to t-3, two-week guard, population SD with a floor of 0.1, at least 5 baseline weeks, alert at 3 or more.

## Run locally

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py                    # needs data/idwr_weekly.csv
JIE_SAMPLE=1 streamlit run app.py       # layout work only, with the synthetic sample
JIE_SAMPLE=1 python -m pytest tests -q
```

Without `data/idwr_weekly.csv` and without `JIE_SAMPLE=1`, the app shows a message and stops. With the sample, the title, a banner and every chart and map are marked SAMPLE DATA.

AppTest does not render the page. After any visual change, look at the app in a browser, and retake screenshots used in slides or write-ups whenever the version changes.

## Deploy

1. Add `data/idwr_weekly.csv` from the R script.
2. Upload everything except the `sample/` folder at `https://github.com/SpatialHealthInformatics/japan-influenza-explorer/upload/main`.
3. On https://share.streamlit.io choose the repository, branch `main`, main file `app.py`. Do not set `JIE_SAMPLE`.
4. Open the app after one to two minutes and link it from the influenza page on the portfolio site.

- Prefecture boundaries: dataofjapan/land (GitHub). For display, islands under 5 km2 or more than 150 km from a prefecture's main island are dropped and the outlines simplified at 0.004 degrees; Okinawa is drawn in an inset. Spatial weights come from the full-resolution file, because simplifying dropped two real borders (Tochigi-Saitama, Tottori-Hiroshima).
