# Japan Influenza Surveillance Explorer

**Open the app:** https://japan-influenza-explorer.streamlit.app

An interactive explorer for weekly influenza sentinel surveillance reports by prefecture from Japan's Infectious Disease Weekly Report (IDWR). The app is available in English and Japanese (日本語). Use the language switch at the top of the sidebar.

Pick up to six prefectures and an IDWR week to see:

- **Spatial Statistics:** global Moran's I, LISA clusters, a Moran scatterplot, and Moran's I by week
- **Chart:** weekly reports per sentinel site against the epidemic threshold (1.0) and the caution (10) and warning (30) levels, with EARS C2 alerts
- **Prefecture Map:** Kanto and Kansai, or your selected prefectures, with the rest of Japan faded
- **Japan Map:** all 47 prefectures with a ranked table
- **Alerts:** C2 by prefecture, alert outcomes, and the New Year check
- **Summary Table:** each prefecture's peak, first week at 1.0, first C2 alert, lead time and false alarms

## Data

This app uses public IDWR data only. The TriNetX pediatric influenza data used in the JSPID comparison is not public, so it is not included. If it becomes available for sharing, it will be added here.

The weekly table has one row per prefecture and ISO week, with reports per sentinel site. It follows the rules of the IDWR alert report: EARS C2 with baseline weeks t-9 to t-3, a two-week guard, a population standard deviation with a floor of 0.1, at least 5 baseline weeks, and an alert at 3 or more.
