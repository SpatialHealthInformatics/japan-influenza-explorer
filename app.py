# Japan Influenza Surveillance Explorer (Streamlit web app)
# Author:   Genie Tang (gtang10@jh.edu)
# Script:   app.py
# Version:  v17
#
# Version log
#   v17 (2026-10-28): Adds IDWR 2026 week 42. The Prefecture Map opens in Bubbles style (like
#        the COVID-19 app Map tab); the shaded maps drop the dots and outline selected
#        prefectures more thickly, with their names, like the COVID-19 World Map.
#   v16 (2026-10-28): Summary Table lists only the prefectures selected in the sidebar
#        (empty when none are selected), with a switch to show all 47; selected
#        prefectures get a dot in their chart color on every map; the Prefecture Map
#        has a Bubbles style like the COVID-19 app; the Japan Map is taller; the four cards stay an all-47 summary and say so.
#   v15 (2026-10-28): AppleGothic is out of the font list, so browsers without
#        Century Gothic use Didact Gothic (a look-alike) and not a Korean system font.
#   v14 (2026-10-28): Spatial Statistics cards are the same height with two-line
#        notes, and the Moran card no longer shows a minus sign ("near 0 means no pattern").
#   v13 (2026-10-28): Summary Table lead range is written in words (for example
#        "1 week after onset to 7 weeks before"), with no minus sign, and the
#        Lead column explains that a negative value means the alert came after onset.
#   v12 (2026-10-28): The red outlines for prefectures with a C2 alert are off
#       by default on the Prefecture Map and Japan Map. In a rising week most
#       prefectures alert (35 of 47 in 2026 week 41), so the red lines crowded
#       the maps. A switch above each map turns them back on; alerts still
#       show in the hover text, the ranked table and the Alerts tab.
#       Maps restyled to match the JSPID map slides: warm colors (cream to
#       dark red), light blue sea, thin gray borders, prefecture names and
#       values on the map, neighbors faded in their own color, small outlying
#       islands left off, Okinawa in an inset. Selected prefectures are
#       outlined in dark blue. Maps use Plotly geo with the world outline file
#       bundled in static/, as in the capstone.
#   v11 (2026-10-28): The third tab is named "Prefecture Map" (was "Map"), so
#       it reads clearly next to "Japan Map". A caption under each map of all
#       of Japan explains the small outlying islands (Tokyo's Izu and
#       Ogasawara islands, Kagoshima's Amami islands, Okinawa). Map outlines
#       are thinner (selected prefectures 1.4 px, alerting prefectures 1.6 px)
#       so they don't hide small prefectures.
#   v10 (2026-10-28): Moran scatterplot labels for the selected prefectures
#       alternate above and below their points, so neighboring labels (Nara and
#       Osaka) no longer overlap. The fourth Spatial Statistics card names the
#       neighbor rule in full: shared border, plus three sea links.
#   v9 (2026-10-28): Real data. data/idwr_weekly.csv holds IDWR reports per
#       sentinel site for all 47 prefectures, 2026 weeks 20 to 41, from the
#       prefecture table written by the IDWR alert report R script (v14,
#       2026-10-20). Summary Table follows the Weeks shown range and uses the
#       R script's onset rule (start of the unbroken run at or above 1.0 that
#       contains the peak); first alert counts from 8 weeks before the onset.
#       Checked against the R output: first alert, onset and lead agree for
#       all 47 prefectures (43 alert first, 3 same week, 1 after; median 2).
#   v8 (2026-10-28): Data notice in a lavender box (light and dark theme
#       colors from the handoff, section 9): the full notice at the top of the
#       About the Data tab, and the one-line version under the app title.
#   v7 (2026-10-28): The app runs only on the real table (data/idwr_weekly.csv).
#       The synthetic sample sits in sample/, outside data/, and loads only
#       when the environment variable JIE_SAMPLE=1 is set; it is then marked on
#       the title, in a banner and across every chart and map. New Year weeks
#       (52, 53, 1) are left out of C2 baselines by default, and the Alerts tab
#       reports how many alerts in weeks 2 to 8 that removes. Geography check:
#       rows outside prefecture codes 1 to 47 (for example a national row) are
#       dropped and reported. False alarms sit next to the lead in the Summary
#       Table. About the Data states that the alerts are retrospective.
#   v6 (2026-10-28): Layout, styling and controls follow the course capstone
#       (capstone.py v48): page title and subtitle with the version; sidebar
#       with "Add a prefecture" and an Add button, the selected list, and
#       Display options; Title Case tabs (Spatial Statistics, Chart,
#       Prefecture Map, Japan Map, Alerts, Summary Table, User Guide, About the
#       Data; Japan Map takes the place of the capstone's World Map); white tiles with a color swatch on the Chart tab; four
#       tinted cards in the portfolio colors on Spatial Statistics; Century
#       Gothic with Didact Gothic as the fallback in the page and in every
#       chart; one chart or one panel per prefecture; a week-range slider;
#       a download button for the plotted data; an alert-threshold slider and
#       one panel per prefecture on the Alerts tab; a Reset map view button
#       above every map with a hint below it; selected prefectures outlined in
#       orange, alerting prefectures in red; 999 permutations for Moran's I
#       and LISA.
#   v5 (2026-10-28): Tabs reordered to follow the capstone. Summary table with
#       the season peak, first week at 1.0, first C2 alert and the lead.
#   v4 (2026-10-28): Kanto, Kansai, and Kanto and Kansai side by side, with
#       the rest of Japan faded; five IDWR color bands.
#   v3 (2026-10-28): EARS C2 matches the IDWR alert report R script (weeks
#       t-9 to t-3, two-week guard, population SD floored at 0.1, at least 5
#       baseline weeks), checked to 14 decimal places against the R output.
#       False-alarm count. Epidemic threshold line at 1.0. Optional sentinels
#       column. Spatial weights from the full-resolution boundaries with
#       Hokkaido-Aomori, Okinawa-Kagoshima and Fukuoka-Yamaguchi links.
#       Option to drop New Year weeks from C2 baselines.
#   v2 (2026-10-28): numpy seeded for global Moran's I; allowed-button toolbars.
#   v1 (2026-10-28): First version.
#
# How to run locally
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#   streamlit run app.py
#
# Data contract: data/idwr_weekly.csv, written by the IDWR alert report R
# script, one row per prefecture per week per disease. Required columns:
# year, week, week_start, pref_code, prefecture, disease, per_sentinel.
# Optional: sentinels, c2, alert. Without that file the app reads
# nothing: it stops with a message. For layout work only, JIE_SAMPLE=1 loads
# sample/idwr_weekly_sample.csv, a synthetic file that must never be deployed.

**Getting started**
1. In the sidebar, pick a prefecture in **Add a prefecture** and press **Add**. You can also type straight into
   **Selected prefectures**. Remove a prefecture with the **x** on its tag. Up to six prefectures can be compared
   at once; each keeps its color while selected.
2. Move **IDWR week** to choose the week shown on the maps, the spatial statistics and the summary table.
3. Drag **Weeks shown** to choose the period on the chart and the alerts.
4. **One panel per prefecture** gives each prefecture its own panel, which helps when one prefecture's values
   dwarf the others. **Log scale** is another way to handle that.
5. **Leave New Year weeks out of C2 baselines** is on by default. Turn it off to use every week, as the R alert
   report does now. The Alerts tab shows how many alerts in weeks 2 to 8 each rule gives.

**Reading the results**
- **Spatial Statistics** tests whether high-reporting prefectures sit next to each other (global Moran's I),
  maps the clusters (LISA), and shows Moran's I for every week, so you can see clusters form through a season.
- **Chart**: the tiles show each prefecture's latest value in the window, its peak, and the number of alert
  weeks. The dashed line is the epidemic threshold (1.0); the dotted lines are the caution (10) and warning (30)
  levels.
- **Prefecture Map** shows Kanto and Kansai side by side, one of them, or only your selected prefectures, with
  the rest of Japan faded. **Japan Map** shades all 47 prefectures and ranks them in a table below. Both offer
  the five IDWR color bands or a continuous scale.
- **Alerts** runs EARS C2 on each selected prefecture and marks the weeks a surveillance system would have raised
  an alert. Move the threshold slider to see how the count changes.
- **Summary Table** gives, for the selected prefectures or all 47, each prefecture's peak, its onset week (sustained 1.0), its first C2 alert, the lead
  between them, and the number of false alarms next to the lead.
- **Download the plotted data** saves exactly what is on the chart as a CSV file.

**Source.** Japan Institute for Health Security (JIHS, formerly NIID), Infectious Disease Weekly Report (IDWR),
weekly reports of sentinel-surveillance diseases by prefecture ([link]({IDWR_URL})). The unit is reports per
sentinel site per week. About 5,000 sentinel clinics and hospitals report influenza nationwide. The number differs
by prefecture and changes from week to week, so per-sentinel values, not raw counts, are comparable across
prefectures.

**How the data were prepared**
- The table is written by the IDWR alert report R script: one row per prefecture, week and disease.
- Each prefecture is placed on a complete weekly grid, so a missing week shows as a gap and cannot shift the C2
  baseline.
- Reports per sentinel are floored at zero.
- Weeks run Monday to Sunday. {"Every year-week label matches the ISO week of its start date." if n_bad == 0 else
  f"{n_bad} week labels do not match the ISO week of their start date; check how IDWR numbers weeks in 53-week years."}
- Geography: one row per prefecture (codes 1 to 47). A national row is never added to a sum; any row with
  another code is dropped. {"All 47 prefectures are present, with the expected names." if not geo_notes else " ".join(geo_notes)}
  The population table uses the same 47 codes and is shown for reference only; no rate in this app divides
  by it.
- This copy uses {c2_source}.

**Thresholds.** 1.0 report per sentinel site marks the start of the influenza epidemic season. IDWR uses 10 and 30
per sentinel as the caution and warning levels for public health center areas; this app draws them at prefecture
level for reference. These lines apply to influenza only.

**Limits of the data.** Sentinel reports reflect care-seeking and reporting practice, not incidence. The latest
week may be revised. Prefectures with few sentinels show more week-to-week noise. Clinic closures around New Year
lower reports in weeks 52 and 1.

**New Year weeks.** The clinic closures around New Year lower reports in weeks 52, 53 and 1, and the rebound
afterward can look like a sudden rise. By default this app leaves weeks 52, 53 and 1 out of every C2 baseline;
the remaining baseline weeks are used if at least 5 are left. The Alerts tab shows how many alerts in weeks 2 to 8
that removes. The R alert report keeps every week, so its January alerts can differ until it uses the same rule.

**These alerts are retrospective.** C2 here runs on the latest file, in which earlier weeks may have been revised
after first publication. A system running in real time would have seen the provisional values each week, and an
alert could have come later, earlier, or not at all. The alert threshold of 3 and the {FA_WINDOW}-week window used
to count false alarms were set while looking at these data. Lead times and false-alarm counts are therefore
best-case estimates for how C2 would perform on future seasons, not a measured real-time performance.

**Spatial statistics.** Global Moran's I and local Moran (LISA) from PySAL `esda`, {PERMUTATIONS} permutations.
Weights: queen contiguity on the full-resolution prefecture boundaries (dataofjapan/land), with Hokkaido-Aomori,
Okinawa-Kagoshima and Fukuoka-Yamaguchi added so every prefecture has a neighbor; row-standardized.
**Alerts.** EARS C2: 7-week baseline (t-9 to t-3), two-week guard, population SD floored at 0.1, at least 5
baseline weeks. **Maps.** Prefecture outlines from dataofjapan/land, simplified for display and bundled in
`static/`, so the maps need no outside download. Population from the 2020 Population Census (e-Stat), shown for
reference only.

**This copy.** {'SAMPLE DATA. Synthetic values for layout only. No real surveillance values are shown.' if is_sample else
